Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-calculator/)

This project was built at the beginning of my career as a developer, following [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

It is intentionally left as-is to document my learning journey and to contribute to the open-source community so that other students can learn from the same project stages.

Also, as directed by The Odin Project's guidelines:

> When making interactive projects, like this one, you might be tempted to add more features, improve interactivity, user experience, design and styling of your website, and so on.
> 
> We recommend not doing that, and saving this effort for your portfolio projects. Focus mainly on the requirements of the project.


About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) curriculum. It is the fifth and final project required for completion of the Foundations Course.

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Start by creating `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` functions.
- [x] Create three variables for each of the parts of a calculator operation. Create a variable for the first number, the operator, and the second number.
- [x] Create a new function `operate` that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.
- [x] Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key.
- [x] Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons.
- [x] You’ll need to store the first number and second number that are input into the calculator, utilize the operator that the user selects, and then operate() on the two numbers when the user presses the “=” key.

-- Extra credit

- [x] Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers.
- [x] Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
- [x] Add keyboard support!
- [x] Build the visuals using Flexbox.


What I Learned
-----

I learned the basics of Objects, accessing object properties, using multiple object operators, understanding the differences between object and primitive data types, and several array methods like map, filter, and reduce.


Notes
-----

Building this was both hard and fun. 

I tried my best to make it bug-free, but I'm pretty sure there are some bugs here and there. 

Still, it's mostly functional, and my time is better spent building new shiny toys.

P.S. - If you were bored enough to test this out and found a bug, let me know. I probably won’t fix them, but I’ll definitely appreciate your effort in trying it out!
